# Quote-Based Reward System for Nigerian Readers

## Overview

This system rewards Nigerian users for reading books by allowing them to submit quotes from real books and earn ₦10 for each verified quote. The goal is to incentivize reading while providing small financial rewards that can help with daily expenses like airtime, data, or snacks.

## Core Philosophy

> "Reading helped me get better at life and now I earn. But if only I had ways to get small money to cater for small things like airtime, internet data, sweets, or minor things that small cash could handle, life would have been a lot easier."

This system bridges the gap between reading for personal growth and earning small amounts for daily needs, specifically targeting Nigerian readers who understand the value of books but need financial motivation.

## How It Works

### For Users:
1. **Add Books**: Users can add books to their library either by:
   - Selecting from existing books in their collection
   - Searching and adding new books via Google Books API
   - Manually adding books (flagged for admin verification)

2. **Submit Quotes**: Users submit exact quotes from books they're reading:
   - Quote text must be verbatim (exactly as written in the book)
   - Must include the correct page number
   - Minimum 10 characters, maximum 1000 characters
   - Each quote earns ₦10 when verified

3. **Track Progress**: Users can monitor:
   - Pending quotes awaiting verification
   - Verified quotes and earnings
   - Rejected quotes with reasons
   - Total balance and transaction history

### For Admins:
1. **Quote Verification Queue**: Admins see all pending quotes with:
   - User information
   - Book details (title, author, cover)
   - Quote text and page number
   - Submission timestamp

2. **Verification Process**: Admins manually verify quotes by:
   - Cross-referencing with the actual book
   - Checking page numbers match
   - Ensuring quotes are verbatim
   - Approving or rejecting with reasons

3. **Bulk Operations**: Admins can:
   - Approve multiple quotes at once
   - Bulk reject with common reasons
   - View system-wide statistics

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

#### Quotes Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  user_id: ObjectId,
  book_id: ObjectId,
  quote_text: String,
  page_number: Number,
  status: String, // 'pending', 'verified', 'rejected'
  submitted_at: Date,
  verified_at: Date,
  verified_by: ObjectId,
  rejection_reason: String,
  reward_amount: Number // Default: 10
}
```

#### Transactions Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  user_id: ObjectId,
  amount: Number,
  reward_type: String, // 'quote_verified'
  quote_id: ObjectId,
  description: String,
  timestamp: Date,
  status: String // 'completed', 'pending', 'failed'
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Initialization
```bash
python init_quotes_db.py
```

### 2. Environment Variables
```bash

GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # Optional, for enhanced features
```

### 3. Admin Setup

### 4. User Onboarding

- Submit quotes from books they're actively reading

## Usage Examples

### User Workflow
1. User adds "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe to their library
2. While reading, they find a meaningful quote on page 45
3. They submit: "The white man is very clever. He came quietly and peaceably with his religion..."
4. Admin verifies the quote against the actual book
5. User receives ₦10 and can track it in their transaction history

### Admin Workflow
1. Admin sees pending quote in verification queue
2. Checks the quote against the book (page 45 of Things Fall Apart)
3. Verifies the quote is exact and approves it
4. User's balance is automatically updated
5. Transaction is logged for audit purposes

## Scaling Considerations

### Current Limitations
- Manual verification process (labor-intensive)
- Requires admin knowledge of books
- Limited to books admins can access

### Future Enhancements

2. **OCR Integration**: Scan book pages for automatic verification
3. **Publisher Partnerships**: Direct access to book content for verification
4. **Machine Learning**: Pattern recognition for common quote formats
5. **Mobile App**: Dedicated app for easier quote submission

## Financial Model

### Revenue Sustainability
- Current model: Admin-funded rewards
- Target: 100 quotes = ₦1,000 per user
- Consideration: Need sustainable funding source as user base grows

### Potential Revenue Streams
1. **Book Sales Commissions**: Partner with bookstores
